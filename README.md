This project is a full recreation of the official Apple iPhone 15 Pro website, designed to showcase a perfect blend of smooth animations and 3D effects using cutting-edge web technologies. The goal is to replicate the fluid, interactive experience that users encounter on Apple's site, with a special focus on combining GSAP animations and Three.js 3D models.

<h2>Project Features:</h2>
<h3>GSAP Animations:</h3>

<h4>Smooth Transitions:</h4> The website leverages GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) to create smooth, hardware-accelerated animations for page transitions, text reveals, and dynamic content effects.
<h4>Custom Scroll Animations:</h4> Custom scroll-based animations are implemented using GSAP’s ScrollTrigger plugin, allowing content to animate as users scroll through the page. These animations include seamless transitions between sections, text sliding in/out of view, and image animations triggered on scroll.
<h4>Responsive Interactivity:</h4> GSAP ensures all animations are fluid across devices, with optimized performance for mobile and desktop experiences, enhancing the overall user interaction.
<h3>Three.js 3D Effects:</h3>

<h4>Interactive 3D Models:</h4> Using Three.js, the project features interactive, animated 3D models of the iPhone 15 Pro. Users can interact with the model, allowing for dynamic views of the product with smooth 360-degree rotations, zooming, and lighting effects.
<h4>Custom 3D Animations:</h4> The 3D models are animated using GSAP to add transitions, movement, and rotations, mimicking the real-life interactions of the iPhone. From hover effects to automated sequences, the models bring life to the website.
<h4>Realistic Lighting and Textures:</h4> With Three.js, realistic lighting, materials, and reflections are applied to the 3D models to replicate the premium look and feel of the iPhone. Special focus is placed on achieving Apple's high-end aesthetic using sophisticated shaders and textures.
<h3>Fluid User Experience:</h3>

<h4>Performance Optimizations:</h4> Combining GSAP and Three.js requires precise performance tuning to maintain smooth interactions and animations. The project utilizes lazy-loading techniques, texture optimizations, and effective use of browser GPU rendering to ensure minimal load times and zero lag during interaction.
<h4>Mobile and Desktop Compatibility:</h4> The design and animations are fully responsive, with optimizations for both mobile and desktop experiences. The website maintains high fidelity across devices, ensuring a consistent look and feel for all users.
<h2>Attention to Detail:</h2>

The project meticulously replicates the intricate design choices made by Apple, from the layout of product details to the subtle animations that make the website feel dynamic and premium. This includes detailed interactions such as button hover effects, subtle loading animations, and transitions between product features.
<h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
<h3>GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):</h3> For high-performance, timeline-based animations and scroll-triggered interactions.
<h3>Three.js:</h3> For creating, rendering, and animating 3D models in the browser, giving life-like interactions to the iPhone 15 Pro.
<h3>React:</h3> The frontend framework to build reusable components and manage the dynamic flow of the website.
<h3>CSS (Tailwind CSS):</h3> For styling and ensuring a responsive design that adapts across various screen sizes.
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
This project aims to push the boundaries of what can be achieved with web-based animations and 3D modeling, while delivering a highly interactive and immersive experience for users. It showcases how web developers can use GSAP and Three.js to create sophisticated animations and 3D experiences, similar to Apple’s design standards.
